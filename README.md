The following contains my work from my time with the USC Theoretical Cosmology Group.
<br><br>
Project 1:<br>
The start of an implementation of analytic interacting dark matter functionality to the ARES code (https://ares.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). Paused to the start of project 2.
<br><br>
Project 2:<br>
Work corresponding to paper in prep on new dark matter-proton interaction limits. These limits represent the most stringent constraints on these interactions to date.
